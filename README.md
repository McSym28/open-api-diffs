# OpenAPI Generator Diffs

This repository contains generated code from [aj-foster/open-api-generator](https://github.com/aj-foster/open-api-generator).
Each tag contains code generated by a different commit of the code generator (whether part of `main` or a pull request).
Using these tags, and the git diffs between them, we can evaluate changes to the code generator.
